Course Project 1

The project should give you a pseudo ordering process throught your console.
This project should end up saving a lot of time ordering product that is needed for a medical marijuana dispensary (though not limited to that) and maybe even more, such as automating it.
Get started by agreeing to place an order. After that, select what you'd like to order and how much.

For help, you would need to contact me in via GitHub.
I, Taylor Chappell, maintain and contribute to it mostly. Any tips would be appreciated. Currently the problem I am having is the second "in" statement isn't reading properly and the switch doesn't close properly.
